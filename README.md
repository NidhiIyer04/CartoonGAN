# Cartoon GAN

This project implements a Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network (DCGAN) to generate cartoon images. The model is designed to generate high-quality cartoon images using TensorFlow.

## Introduction
The Cartoon GAN project aims to create a neural network capable of generating cartoon-style images. This project leverages the power of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), specifically a Deep Convolutional GAN (DCGAN), to achieve its goal.

## Features
- Implementation of DCGAN using TensorFlow.
- Regularization techniques to achieve a generator loss of 4.56.
- Training on a custom dataset of cartoon images.
- Capability to generate high-quality cartoon images despite resource constraints.

## Results
The model achieves a generator loss of 4.56. Example generated images are shown in the notebook.
